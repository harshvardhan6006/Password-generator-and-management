# Password-Management-System



The password management system addresses the challenges of password security and management faced by individuals and organizations. Weak and easily guessable passwords are common, leading to security breaches and data loss. Managing multiple passwords across various accounts is time-consuming and confusing. Users often forget passwords or resort to reusing 
them, increasing the risk of breaches. The password management system offers a centralized solution by storing and managing passwords securely. It also provides tools for generating strong passwords. With this system, users can enhance password security, minimize the risk of breaches, and streamline password management processes.
